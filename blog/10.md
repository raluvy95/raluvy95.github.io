Adobe decided to crack down its customers with new TOS which customers has no chance but to accept in order to continue using their services. [The new TOS allows Adobe](https://nichegamer.com/photoshop-terms-of-service-grants-adobe-access-to-user-projects-for-content-moderation/) [to spy on their customers and to train their AI and content moderation](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173838/adobe-tos-update-firefly-generative-ai-trust). There is no reason to continue using Adobe's software.
