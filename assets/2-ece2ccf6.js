# Welcome to the blog website
If you have been here before the redesign of my website, yes... I redesigned this website to make it more minimal. This isn't my first redesign attempt, I've attempted many times for years. Hopefully the current design of the website will be timeless. Simple design, simple time.

You can actually change the color to fit your needs. I'll polish the color picker (the default input type="color" is different across platform) and eventually I will implement the profile colors.

For who are reading this, have a wonderful day ðŸ˜¸ ~~Ignore the previously markdown files, they're for testing purpose~~
