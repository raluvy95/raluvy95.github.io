This technology allows for web browsers to render Adobe Flash content, which contains videos, interactive apps and even video games. In early 2010s, Flash content was used in <strong>over 50%</strong> of all websites.
Flash is well known today for its Flash games and animations. Most of them are hosted on <a href="https://newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a>.</p> <p>If you were on the Internet in the 2000s, you likely experienced trying to make Internet Explorer work with Flash Player.</p> <h2>Problems</h2> <p>Since this technology was not an open standard (aka proprietary) it lead to <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-6761/Adobe-Flash-Player.html">a lot of security issues</a>. Adobe took a lot of time to patch most of them, even severe ones which were actively used by bad actors.
If you wonder why did people use Flash at the time of its peak, don’t blame them, because they didn’t have many options that worked well at that time. There were open source version of this technology such as <a href="https://lightspark.github.io/">Lightspark</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">GNU Gnash</a>. None of them were good enough though.
Another reason why people used it was because web technology at that time wasn’t as powerful as Flash content. Remember, HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 JS weren’t even a thing back then!!! Browsing the web wasn’t possible or very limited without Flash installed.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>I’m so glad the Flash Player is gone (even though it’s still used in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player#Mainland_China%E2%80%93specific_variant">China</a>) I agree that removing Flash support will finally make the web more secure… unless you’re trying to browse old websites with Flash content in them.
Flash games, however, get to stay alive, even though Flash itself is dead. A lot of Flash games were re-exported to HTML5 and there is a browser extension called <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> to run Flash content.</p> <p>I wish I experienced browsing Flash contents in the 2000s.</p>`,l(e,"class","markdown-body")},m(t,o){d(t,e,o)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&w(e)}}}const u={};class g extends n{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,p,r,{})}}export{g as default,u as frontmatter};
