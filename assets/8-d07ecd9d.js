With the release of various AI tools, people have praised and criticized for adoption of AI. Some thinks it will take our job forever, others will use it to speed up and improve production.</p> <p>AI and jobs, in my opinion, should work together. Getting your job replaced with AI only creates more problem (e.g. quality, creativity and reliability) than just saving a few bucks. There are known examples of doing this such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/10/duolingo-ai-layoffs/">Duolingo</a>. If you have been using Duolingo and noticed that the quality of contents are getting worse, that’s why.</p> <p>However, the usage of AI doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Sometimes I use AI to get information very quick and help solve my homework. I use Gemini AI to identify the picture (yes you can upload photo for free).</p> <p>The developement of AI is improving at exponential growth and probably no signs of stopping it. I remember when I used a <a href="https://www.craiyon.com/">craiyon</a> (formely DALL-E mini) in 2022 when it was first launched. The results were hilariously awful, even if you give them non-sense prompt. This was nothing compared to Microsoft’s Bing AI.</p> <p>Comparision, prompt: “meow meow meow meow”:
<a href="assets/craiyon.png">Craiyon</a> vs <a href="assets/bingai.png">Bing AI</a></p> <p>I am in favour of regularing this new technology and should be enough regulated in most countries by 2030. Without AI regulation, <a href="https://gitnux.org/ai-replacing-jobs-statistics/">this will affect the jobs around the world</a></p> <p>In conclusion, AI changed the world. Usage of AI should be regulated before the world turns into a real life Fallout.</p>`,l(e,"class","markdown-body")},m(o,i){p(o,e,i)},p:t,i:t,o:t,d(o){o&&u(e)}}}const f={};class g extends n{constructor(e){super(),s(this,e,null,d,r,{})}}export{g as default,f as frontmatter};
