As known as:

I hope you guys enjoy your free day! In a country where I live, we celebrate labour day with special foods such as [mici](https://balkazaar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MICI-COVER-BALKAZAAR-scaled.jpg) and [cozonac](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Cozonac-cu-nuca-103.jpg)
