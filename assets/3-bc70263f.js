# Improvements of my website
<!-- what is your github username again -->
Me and [NRD](https://github.com/NRDsstuff) continue to improve my website. So far we've added profile colors and redesigned the preferences window.

As you can see, my website is getting more polished and looks great thanks to [NRD](https://github.com/NRDsstuff)'s hard work! NRD, if you are seeing this I love you so much ðŸ’™

I will continue to post this for updates about me.
